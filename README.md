<h1>Goldbach</h1>

<h2>What is Goldbach?</h2>
<p>Goldbach is an unsolved number problem theory stating every integer greater than 2 can be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers. For example:<p>
<ul>
  <li>4 = 2 + 2</li>
  <li>6 = 3 + 3</li>
  <li>8 = 3 + 5</li>
  <li>10 = 3 + 7 = 5 + 5</li>
  <li>12 = 5 + 7</li>
</ul>
